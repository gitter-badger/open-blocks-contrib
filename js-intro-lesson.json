OpenBlocks is an open description language for building online
courses in the coursera/codeschool model. Courses take the form
course -> topics -> lessons -> sections.

Starting at the bottom, a "section" is a part of a lesson - it's a
paragraph of text, a video or audio file, an individual or group
activity, a reference to another document, a resource for printing,
or a slide for projection.
